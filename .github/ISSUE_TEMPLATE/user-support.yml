            Before submitting a **User Report** issue, please ensure the following:

            **1:** You are running the latest version of SwarmUI. You can go to `Server` -> then press `Update and Restart` to update.
            **2:** You have made an effort to find public answers to your question before asking here. In other words, you googled it first, and scrolled through recent help topics. It's also wise to do a CTRL+F search on the [SwarmUI Discord](https://discord.gg/q2y38cqjNw).

            In general we recommend most support questions go through the [SwarmUI Discord](https://discord.gg/q2y38cqjNw).
