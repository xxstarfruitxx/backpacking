# SwarmUI Extensions

Currently there are only a few extensions out there, and they can be found on the Extensions tab.

### How To Find and Install Extensions

- Launch Swarm and go to `Server` -> `Extensions`
- If you like the sound one, look at its readme to make sure you want it. If so, hit the "Install" button.

See also the Extensions channel in The SwarmUI Discord.
