# ComfyUI Backend Extension For StableSwarmUI

This extension enables the use of [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) as a backend provider for StableSwarmUI.

Among other benefits, this enables you to use custom ComfyUI-API workflow files within StableSwarmUI.

You can also view the ComfyUI node graph and work with custom workflows directly in the UI when any comfy backend is enabled.

(TODO): explain the API-specific workflow file format, how it differs from workflows in the UI, and how to use it.

(Note: this readme section should mention that the main checkpoint loader should be ID `4` for best compatibility, due to how ComfyUI loads models - see `just_load_model.json`)
