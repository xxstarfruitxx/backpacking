# UI Sounds in SwarmUI

If you want to to have the UI play sounds in specific situations, you just need to add a sound file and select it for the relevant context.

### Add a sound file

- Pick any `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`, ... sound file.
    - Here's an online collection of ding sounds if you want https://bigsoundbank.com/search?q=notification
- Store the file in `SwarmUI/Data/Audio`
- Refresh your Swarm page or restart Swarm (file listing does not currently auto-update, TBD)
