# Custom Comfy Workflows In SwarmUI

(Placeholder)

**TODO:**
- generate outlinks to info about Comfy itself
- how to work with custom comfy workflows in general inside Swarm
    - notably the workflow browser tool and all
- multi-backend split usage
- how to push to the Generate tab
    - considerations like how save nodes work
    - how to use power features like Grid generation with comfy workflows
    - how to use the Comfy Workflow parameter to grid different workflows at once
    - how to remove the comfy link
- Generate tab parameters:
    - how the default workflow parameter linker works
    - how to link default parameters (primitives)
    - how to build custom parameters and groups (`SwarmInput` nodes)
- how to use the Simple tab (how to add/configure workflows there, how to share them with others)
